        <p>Hello all! My name is Daniel Sanchez and this is my first website! I am currently studying full stack web development at UCF. 
            This is my first time learning how to code and I am finding it challenging yet exciting!</p>

        <p>I was born and raised on Long Island, NY. I have been in Florida for about 13 years now and I love it. I attended Flagler College for my undergraduate degree.
            I majored in Sport Management and Minored in Sociology. I am starting this new journey in my life in order to keep challening myself as well as enter the field of web development.
            Some things I enjoy are traveling with my girl friend, Pamela, playing and watching sports, and hanging out with family and friends.</p>
